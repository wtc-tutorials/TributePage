The man who transformed the struggle for Black dignity

Malcolm X, center stage, inspires thousands with his fierce truth and unshakable conviction.

Here’s a timeline of Malcolm X’s life:

1925 – Born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska.

1931 – His father, Earl Little, a Baptist minister and follower of Marcus Garvey, dies under suspicious circumstances, leaving the family devastated.

1939 – Sent to a foster home after his mother is institutionalized. Despite excelling in school, Malcolm leaves after a teacher tells him a law career “isn’t realistic for a negro.”

1946 – Convicted of burglary and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Incarceration becomes the turning point — he educates himself through voracious reading and joins the Nation of Islam.

1952 – Paroled and meets Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm drops his “slave name” and becomes Malcolm X, symbolizing his lost African heritage.

1954 – Becomes minister of the Harlem Temple No. 7 and quickly grows into a national figure for the Nation of Islam, known for his fiery speeches and message of self-respect, discipline, and Black pride.

1959 – Travels to the Middle East and Africa, strengthening global ties with anti-colonial leaders.

1963 – Breaks with the Nation of Islam over its leadership and doctrine, founding the Muslim Mosque, Inc. His message begins to evolve — from separation to unity through shared human rights.

1964 – Makes his pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Profoundly changed, he embraces Sunni Islam, adopts the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, and begins advocating for racial equality on a global, human level.

1964–1965 – Travels widely across Africa and the Middle East, meeting leaders such as Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. He calls for Black Americans to take their case for human rights before the United Nations.

1965 – Assassinated on February 21 in New York City at the age of 39, while addressing the Organization of Afro-American Unity.

"If you’re not ready to die for it, put the word ‘freedom’ out of your vocabulary."
— Malcolm X
